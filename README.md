BioViz Assignment 2

EDITS FOR RESUBMIT
I was able to create the distance table, sort through the distance table replacing nodes with parents, placing nodes onto an array for tree making.
The tree can get made correctly with the correct data (commented out in the beginning).
However while traversing through the distance table all parent nodes do not get placed onto the tree array properly therefore it still does not work.
